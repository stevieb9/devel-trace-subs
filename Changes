0.06    2015-09-14
    - install_trace() now uses DES->inject(inject_after_sub_def => [])
      instead of DES->inject_after()
    - modules no longer have to be loaded prior to install/remove,
      as a bug was fixed in DES
    - include/exclude parameters no longer are useful, all subs will
      be injected to
