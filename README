NAME

    Devel::Trace::Flow - Generate, track, store and print code flow and
    stack traces.

SYNOPSIS

        use Devel::Trace::Flow qw(trace trace_dump);
    
        # add a trace() call to the top of all your subs
    
        trace();
    
        # then from anywhere (typically calling script), dump the output
    
        trace_dump();

DESCRIPTION

    This module facilitates keeping track of a project's code flow and
    stack trace information in calls between subroutines.

    Optionally, you can use this module to automatically inject the
    appropriate trace() calls into some or all subs in individual files,
    all Perl files within a directory structure, or even in production
    files by specifying its Module::Name.

EXPORT

        C<trace, trace_dump>

FUNCTIONS

 trace

    Parameters: None

    Puts the call onto the stack trace. Call it in scalar context to
    retrieve the data structure as it currently sits.

 trace_dump

    Dumps the output of the collected data.

    All of the following parameters are optional.

    want => 'string', type => 'html', file => 'file.ext'

    want: Takes either 'flow' or 'stack', and will output the respective
    data collection. If this parameter is omitted, both code flow and stack
    trace information is dumped.

    type: Has only a single value, 'html. This will dump the output in HTML
    format.

    file: Takes the name of a file as a parameter. The dump will write
    output to the file specified. The program will die if the file can not
    be opened for writing.
