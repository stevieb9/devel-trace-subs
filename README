NAME

    Devel::Trace::Flow - Generate, track, store and print code flow and
    stack traces.

SYNOPSIS

        use Devel::Trace::Flow qw(trace trace_dump);
    
        # add a trace() call to the top of all your subs
    
        trace();
    
        # then from anywhere (typically calling script), dump the output
    
        trace_dump();
    
        # automate the installation into a file (or all files in a directory)
    
        inject_trace(file => 'filename'); # or directory, or 'Module::Name'

DESCRIPTION

    This module facilitates keeping track of a project's code flow and
    stack trace information in calls between subroutines.

    Optionally, you can use this module to automatically inject the
    appropriate trace() calls into some or all subs in individual files,
    all Perl files within a directory structure, or even in production
    files by specifying its Module::Name.

EXPORT

    None by default. See EXPORT_OK

EXPORT_OK

        C<trace, trace_dump, inject_trace>

FUNCTIONS

 trace

    Parameters: None

    Note: To completely disable tracing, set DTF_DISABLE_TRACE environment
    variable to a true value from anywhere in the call stack (the calling
    script is most effective).

    Puts the call onto the stack trace. Call it in scalar context to
    retrieve the data structure as it currently sits.

 trace_dump

    Dumps the output of the collected data.

    All of the following parameters are optional.

    want => 'string', type => 'html', file => 'file.ext'

    want: Takes either 'flow' or 'stack', and will output the respective
    data collection. If this parameter is omitted, both code flow and stack
    trace information is dumped.

    type: Has only a single value, 'html. This will dump the output in HTML
    format.

    file: Takes the name of a file as a parameter. The dump will write
    output to the file specified. The program will die if the file can not
    be opened for writing.

 inject_trace

    Automatically injects the necessary code into Perl files to facilitate
    stack tracing.

    In addition to adding the appropriate use statement into each file, it
    adds a trace(); call to all (or specified) subroutines.

    Parameters:

    file => 'filename' - Mandatory: 'filename' can be the name of a single
    file, a directory, or even a 'Module::Name'. If the filename is a
    directory, we'll iterate recursively through the directory, and make
    the changes to all .pl and .pm files underneath of it. If filename is a
    'Module::Name', we'll load the file for that module dynamically, and
    modify it. CAUTION: this will edit live production files.

    copy => 'filename' - Optional: The name of a backup file. We'll copy
    the file in file parameter and copy it to the file name specified, and
    only work on the copied version, leaving the original file alone.

    include => [qw(sub1 sub2)] - Optional: An array reference with the
    names of subroutines you want to include. If include is sent in, only
    these subs will be modified, ie. all others will be excluded by
    default.

    exclude => [qw(sub1 sub2)]> - Optional: This has the exact opposite
    effect as include. Note that if exclude is sent in, include is rendered
    useless.
